# iMrDJAi-MDE - Coming Soon..
${Mr.DJA} Markdown Editor - Open source, Simple, Easy to use and fully featured markdown editor built with vanilla Javascript, and powered by good libraries.
***
## For Testing
Thats the [Github Pages](https://imrdjai.github.io/iMrDJAi-MDE/?version=) link, it will be used as a demo, and to preview the changes and the new commits while development in real time. You will see that the URL is followed with a query (`?version=`), it's just a trick to flush the cache and to force page to show its new changes. You can put any random string that you didn't use before as its value.
## To-Do
- [ ] Make it responsive.
- [ ] Add a resize button (to make it easy to resize for mobile users).
- [ ] Update the sup/subscript regex (to support using the links syntex).
- [ ] Update the Embeds system (it needs more work).
- [ ] More unexpected work.
- [ ] First release.
## Future plans
- Add Codemirror and customize the markdown mode to add the new tags.
- Add new tags:
  - Colors (using Â§n like Minecraft).
  - Task-lists (like Github).
  - Emojies (like Discord).
  - More..
