# iMrDJAi-MDE - Coming Soon..
${Mr.DJA} Markdown Editor - Open source, Simple, Easy to use and fully featured markdown editor built with vanilla Javascript, and powered by good libraries.
***
## For Testing
Thats the [Github Pages](https://imrdjai.github.io/iMrDJAi-MDE/?version=) link, it will be used as a demo, and to preview the changes and the new commits while development in real time.

**Note:** You will see that the URL is followed with a query (`?version=`), it's just a trick to flush the cache and to force page to show its new changes. You can put any random string that you didn't use before as its value.
## To-Do
- [x] Make it responsive.
- [x] Add a resize button (to make it easy to resize for mobile users).
- [x] Update the sup/subscript regex (to support using the links syntax).
- [ ] Update the Embeds system (it needs more work).
- [x] ~~Add customizable text length limit.~~ (no need, maxlength attribute on textarea tag can handle that).
- [x] Update the help text.
- [x] Shouldn't I replace the image button with an embed button? (because the MDE now supports videos, audios, embeds and more).
- [ ] More unexpected work.
- [ ] First release.
## Problems
- [x] I need to find a way to apply aspect ratio on Youtube iframes. It should be: aspect-ratio: 16:9, max-width: 100%, min-width: 200px.
## Future plans
- Add Codemirror and customize the markdown mode to add the new tags.
- Add new tags:
  - Colors (using Â§n like Minecraft).
  - Task-lists (like Github).
  - Emojies (like Discord).
  - More..
## Note
More contributors are needed. if you are interested to join me to maintain this project, just open an issue.
