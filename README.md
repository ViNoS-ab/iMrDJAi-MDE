## For Testing
Thats the [Github Pages](https://imrdjai.github.io/iMrDJAi-MDE/?version=) link, it will be used as a demo, and to preview the changes and the new commits while development in real time. You will see that the URL is followed with a query (`?version=`), it's just a trick to flush the cache and to force page to show its new changes. You can put any random string that you didn't use before as its value.
